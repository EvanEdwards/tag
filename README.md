# tag - File Tagger

version 0.0.1

This is a working but infant little program.  For details
use tag --help for information.  Or read the code (the help
is toward the top).



## Warning

Be warned, this is my first nim code, and I wrote this in part
to learn nim.  I am absolutely sure this is the kind of thing
where I will return, less ignorant, and be merciless in my 
review of my current (former?) self's choices.  

That's partially why it is a monolithic block with some iffy 
structure.  I learned as I went.  But the code does work and 
I have some ideas on extending it.  

In short: this is not good code to learn nim from.
